# Udacity-Landing-Page
I started out by creating the styling of the landing page with the HTML elements and styling them through CSS 
The second part was to dynamically create the navigation menu 
The usability of the nav should be to click on a section and be directed to that part of the page I was able to do this using an anchor tag which had matching # names with the respective section
